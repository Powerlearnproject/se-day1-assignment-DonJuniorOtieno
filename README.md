Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is the use of sound engineering principles, methods and tools to produce  high quality software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines
-It is important as it drives innovation, builds reliable software,enable digital transormation and support economic growth

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Software crisis-transitoned to systematic coding and engineered focused approached
2. Rise of Object Oriented Programming-improved software maintainability and allowed more complexed and realistic modelling for systems
3. Advent of Agile methodologies and Devops-have signifiantly improved software delivery speed,quality and resposiveness

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning-defining goals, resources and feasibility
Requirement analysis-Specific needs are gathered and documented
2. Design-creating and outlinin how it will function
3. Coding-where code is writen
4. Testing-fixing bugs and ensuring software meets requirements
5. Deployment-Release to the users
6. Maintenance-updating,fixing bugs and improve perfomance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile methodoly allows frequent continuous feedback and ongoing testing throught the development while waterfall feedback is at the begining and at the end and tested only after coding is completed
Agile is appropiate in startups where user feedback is crucial whereas waterfall is appropiate in a strict lregal system where specificifications must be finalized upfront

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. software developer-writes,tests and maintains code, fixes bugs,optimizes perfomance, collaborates with designers
2. Quality Assuarance Engineer-ensures software meets standards, executes test cases, identifies security vulnerabilities, works to improve realibilty of the software
3. Project maganer-Oversees planind and execution, defines project deadlines, manages the team, ensures project aligns with bussines goals

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. They increase productivity-integrate debuggers,offer error detections and code completion
2. Enhanced code navigations-simpifies navigation in large databases
3. language specific support-they support specific language by providing tailored tools e.g vs code
4.Auditing-keeps track of who changed what
5. Branching and merging- allows developers to intergrate changes seemlessly
6. Backup and recovery- vsc serves as backup protecting against dataloss 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Tight deadlines-planning  and estimation to avoid deadlines
2. Evolving requirements- by continuous learning to stay upto date
3. Seecurity concerns-by continouous auditing to avoid it
4. Code quality and concerns- by automated testing to improve quality
5. Technical debt- by refactoring to reduce debt and improved maintainability

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit-testing of individual units or componets of software in isolation, allows early bug detection,improves code confidence and improves code design
2. Intergration- focuses on testing interaction between different units or components, itverifies sytems behaviour, interaction with bug control and ensures interface validation
3. System- testing of entire system end to end, it ensures system meets all requiremnet, ensures perfomance and stability and ensures end to end functionality
4. Acceptance-conducted by end users to verify the software meets bussiness requirement, it ensures customer satisfaction, ensures it meets bussines requirements and provides a final quality check

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input text that guides an AI mode to generate specific accurate response
1. Improves accuracy and relevance
2. It controls AI behaviour
3. Enhances users experience
4. Mitigates against harmful outputs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Write something about cars, it is vague since it is just a broad topic rather than write a 4-paragraph summary on the evolution of cars and there use in the modern world, it is more clear and cocise to the point, hence it addresses the specific goals to be achieves while searching on the information
